Follow technical documentation to integrate Trello Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: medium\n---\n\n# Trello Trigger node\n\n[Trello](https://trello.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application which is a subsidiary of Atlassian. Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/trello.md).\n///\n\n///  note  | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Trello Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/trello-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.\n///\n\n## Find the Model ID\n\nThe model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.\n\nFor this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:\n\n1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.\n2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.\n3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.\n4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.\n5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n.\n\n",
