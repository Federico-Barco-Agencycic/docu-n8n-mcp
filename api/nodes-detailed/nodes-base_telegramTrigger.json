Follow technical documentation to integrate Telegram Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: critical\n---\n\n# Telegram Trigger node\n\n[Telegram](https://telegram.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a cloud-based instant messaging and voice over IP service. Users can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers, audio, and files of any type. On this page, you'll find a list of events the Telegram Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/telegram.md).\n///\n\n///  note  | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Telegram Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/telegram-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.\n///\n\n## Events\n\n- **`*`**: All updates except \"Chat Member\", \"Message Reaction\", and \"Message Reaction Count\" (default behavior of Telegram API as they produces a lot of calls of updates).\n- **Business Connection**: Trigger when the bot is connected to or disconnected from a business account, or a user edited an existing connection with the bot.\n- **Business Message**: Trigger on a new message from a connected business account.\n- **Callback Query**: Trigger on new incoming callback query.\n- **Channel Post**: Trigger on new incoming channel post of any kind — including text, photo, sticker, and so on.\n- **Chat Boost**: Trigger when a chat boost is added or changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates.\n- **Chat Join Request**: Trigger when a request to join the chat is sent. The bot must have the `can_invite_users` administrator right in the chat to receive these updates.\n- **Chat Member**: Trigger when a chat member's status is updated. The bot must be an administrator in the chat.\n- **Chosen Inline Result**: Trigger when the result of an inline query chosen by a user is sent. Please see Telegram's API documentation on [feedback collection](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline#collecting-feedback) for details on how to enable these updates for your bot.\n- **Deleted Business Messages**: Trigger when messages are deleted from a connected business account.\n- **Edited Business Message**: Trigger on new version of a message from a connected business account.\n- **Edited Channel Post**: Trigger on new version of a channel post that is known to the bot is edited.\n- **Edited Message**: Trigger on new version of a channel post that is known to the bot is edited.\n- **Inline Query**: Trigger on new incoming inline query.\n- **Message**: Trigger on new incoming message of any kind — text, photo, sticker, and so on.\n- **Message Reaction**: Trigger when a reaction to a message is changed by a user. The bot must be an administrator in the chat. The update isn't received for reactions set by bots.\n- **Message Reaction Count**: Trigger when reactions to a message with anonymous reactions are changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat. The updates are grouped and can be sent with delay up to a few minutes.\n- **My Chat Member**: Trigger when the bot's chat member status is updated in a chat. For private chats, this update is received only when the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user.\n- **Poll**: Trigger on new poll state. Bots only receive updates about stopped polls and polls which are sent by the bot.\n- **Poll Answer**: Trigger when user changes their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots only receive new votes in polls that were sent by the bot itself.\n- **Pre-Checkout Query**: Trigger on new incoming pre-checkout query. Contains full information about checkout.\n- **Purchased Paid Media**: Trigger when a user purchases paid media with a non-empty payload sent by the bot in a non-channel chat.\n- **Removed Chat Boost**: Trigger when a boost is removed from a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates.\n- **Shipping Query**: Trigger on new incoming shipping query. Only for invoices with flexible price.\n\nSome **events may require additional permissions**, see [Telegram's API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getting-updates) for more information.\n\n## Options\n\n- **Download Images/Files**: Whether to download attached images or files to include in the output data.\n\t- **Image Size**: When you enable **Download Images/Files**, this configures the size of image to download. Downloads large images by default.\n- **Restrict to Chat IDs**: Only trigger for events with the listed chat IDs. You can include multiple chat IDs separated by commas.\n- **Restrict to User IDs**: Only trigger for events with the listed user IDs. You can include multiple user IDs separated by commas.\n\n## Related resources\n\nn8n provides an app node for Telegram.
