Follow technical documentation to integrate Workflow Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: high\n---\n\n# Workflow Trigger node\n\nThe Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.\n\n/// warning | Deprecated\nn8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger.md).\n///\n\n/// note | Keep in mind\nIf you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.\n///\n\nThe Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.\n\n## Node parameters\n\nThe node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:\n\n- **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.\n- **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.\n\nYou can select one or both of these events.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'workflow-trigger') ]]\n",
