Follow technical documentation to integrate Box Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\n---\n\n# Box Trigger node\n\n[Box](https://www.box.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a cloud computing company which provides file sharing, collaborating, and other tools for working with files uploaded to its servers.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/box.md).\n///\n\n///  note  | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Box Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/box-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.\n///\n\n## Find your Box Target ID\n\nTo get your Target ID in Box:\n\n1. Open the file/folder that you would like to monitor.\n2. Copy the string of characters after `folder/` in your URL. This is the target ID. For example, if the URL is `https://app.box.com/folder/12345`, then `12345` is the target ID.\n3. Paste it in the **Target ID** field in n8n.\n\n",
